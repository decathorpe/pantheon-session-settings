# Pantheon Session Settings for fedora

Since upstream elementaryOS ships settings that are tailored to their ubuntu
base, they are incompatible with fedora. This repository is a fork of the
original settings, but adapted to work on fedora. Changes to the original files
will be merged, if possible.
