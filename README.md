# Pantheon Session Settings for fedora

Since upstream elementaryOS ships settings that are tailored to their ubuntu
base, they are incompatible with fedora. This repository is a fork of the
original settings, but adapted to work on fedora. Changes to the original files
will be merged, if possible.

Up until fedora 29, I adapted the files in this repository by hand.
To streamline this process, I have implemented a python script
to do this job for me in the future (`generators/generate.py`).
